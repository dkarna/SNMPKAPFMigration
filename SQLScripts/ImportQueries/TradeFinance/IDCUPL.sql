Dear sir,

I would like to inform you that I am no more interested in continuing as a PL in Computing department at NAMI, so I would like to resign from this post. I will support as a PL for this term of Level 5 and 6 as it may affect the academics. Please search for a good PL so that I can hand over the things smoothly and won't effect the further sessions.
